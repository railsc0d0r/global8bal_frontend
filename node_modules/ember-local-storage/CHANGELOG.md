# Changelog

## 0.1.1
* [BUGFIX] fixes `store.push()` to persist the pushed payload [@Ramblurr](https://github.com/Ramblurr)
* [BUGFIX] normalize query filter keys (`bookPublication` -> `book-publication`) thanks to [@Ramblurr](https://github.com/Ramblurr) for reporting
* [BUGFIX] fixes `queryRecord()` for empty results. The behavior is still irritating because in case of no match we return an empty array. It's an issue with ember-data. See [#3790](https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/3790) as soon as [#3866](https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/3866) makes it into a release `queryRecord()` will return `null`. Thanks to [@Ramblurr](https://github.com/Ramblurr) for reporting.
